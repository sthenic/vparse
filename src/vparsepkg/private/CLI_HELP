usage:
  vparse [OPTIONS] ARGUMENTS


arguments:
  file [file [file ...]]    Input file(s) to parse. To parse several files,
                            separate them by whitespace.

                            Pattern matching is supported but the extent of this
                            support is OS-dependent. The "*.ext" notation is
                            always supported. The glob call is used on POSIX
                            systems.


options:
  -h, --help                Print this help message and exit.
  -v, --version             Print the version information and exit.

  -o=FILE, --output=FILE    If this option is present, the output AST is written
                            to FILE.

  --json                    The output AST is JSON-formatted.

  --pretty                  Prettify the JSON output.

  --stdout                  Write the output to stdout.
